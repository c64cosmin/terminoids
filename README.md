# Asteroids game inside the terminal

![Screenshot](asterscr0.png)

### Building

```
cargo build --release
```

### Running

```
./target/release/terminoids
```

### Gameplay

Unfortunately terminals don't directly support input like UI apps do.
What I mean is that KEY_UP & KEY_DOWN events are not supported,
the way the terminal works is to get a key stroke event and act accordingly.

Due to this limitation the game requires intense keyboard tapping :(

Left - Right  : Rotate ship
Up            : Move forward
Space         : Fire
